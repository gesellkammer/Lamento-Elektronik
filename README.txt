The patch to control the tuning forks can be used with two GUIs: 
* csoundqt 
* open-stage-control.

# CsoundQT

To use CsoundQT, open tuningfork.csd in CsoundQT

# Open Stage Control

Download and install Open-Stage-Control from https://openstagecontrol.ammd.net

* In macOS, just place the .app file in /Applications. 
* In Linux, install the .deb file (make sure that open-stage-control is in the path)

Open a terminal in this directory, then execute at the prompt:

    $ ./tuningfork-start
